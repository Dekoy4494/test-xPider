                    Life before Company was very chaotic — we got a lot of phone calls,
                     a lot of mistyped orders. So with Company, the ability to see the order
                      directly from the customer makes it so streamlined.

                        There’s no way we could have hired these many people and
                         gotten so much business had we not had all of those back-office 
                         systems figured out. It’s been easier growing our company with
                          a system that is so easy and scalable.
